# nasa-asteroid-radar
Andriod App for tracking the asteroids passing near Earth and viewing them, powered by NASA API, developed using Kotlin.

## Getting Started

In com.udacity.asteroidradar.util.Constants.kt insert your version of the api: `API_KEY = "INSERT API KEY HERE"`

Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that is going to display the data of that asteroid once itÂ´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen will also show the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.

## What I learned from this app

Building this app taught me some of the most fundamental skills as an android developer, as fetching data from the internet, saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, clean, compelling UI.
